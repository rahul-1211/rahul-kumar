                It's more rare for a company to dominate multiple
                industries for years at once while continuing 
                to innovative in many others. For Steve Jobs,
                Apple cofounder and former CEO, the goal of Apple
                wasnt simply to create great products, but to create
                a lasting company that will influence the world for 
                generations. While Apples current strength might
                give younger readers the impression that its
                always been a leader in technology, its far from the 
                truth. Just forty-five days from bankruptcy at its 
                worst point, Apples transformation has been a remarkable
                event.

                  The story of Sony has a very interesting start.
                  Sony found its beginning in the wake of World 
                  War II in the war plagued Japan. In 1946, Masaru
                  Ibuka started a radio repair shop electronics shop 
                  in a bomb-damaged department store building in Tokyo
                  with a total of eight employees. The next year, he 
                  was joined by his colleague, Akio Morita, and they 
                  founded a company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (Tokyo 
                  Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). From 
                  early attempts at creating products like the rice-cooker
                  to the later success of creating Japan’s first magnetic recorder,
                  the innovative company went on to create other hit products
                  which won the company widespread recognition and international
                  acclaim as a truly global company known for its quality
                  and innovative products
