            It's more rare for a company to dominate multiple
            industries for years at once while continuing 
            to innovative in many others. For Steve Jobs,
            Apple cofounder and former CEO, the goal of Apple
            wasnt simply to create great products, but to create
            a lasting company that will influence the world for 
            generations. While Apples current strength might
            give younger readers the impression that its
            always been a leader in technology, its far from the 
            truth. Just forty-five days from bankruptcy at its 
            worst point, Apples transformation has been a remarkable
            event.

            An e-commerce company from China, Alibaba
            is currently the biggest IPO in the world. 
            The Group provides business to customer and 
            customer to customer sales and services through
            the web portals. Alibaba’s other services include
            electronic payments, cloud computing services that
            are data centric and search engines for shopping. 
            The founders of the company are Jack Ma and Penh Lei.
            An English teacher by profession, Jack Ma lacked in 
            computer knowledge. He made up for this weakness with 
            his vision. Ma  and 17 of his friends launched Alibaba 
            in 1999.
